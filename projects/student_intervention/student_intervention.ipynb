In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "* Logistic Regression\n",
    "    * Logistic regression is generally applied to classificiation problems and provides an output prediction per example that is bounded by 0 and 1, and can be thus be interpreted as a probability. A threshold can then be set to assign a predicted class as per that prediction. Typically a strength of logistic regression is that it provides this probabilistic interpretation, and that one can interpret the magnitude and sign of the model coefficients to give insight to the most important features in the model. Additionally, logistic regression provides handles to avoid overtraining through regularization parameters. Possible weaknesses are that it assumes one only has two levels in the target variable, and if we had more than two levels the prediction may be worse. Another weakness of a naive application of logistic regression is that the model assumes no interactions between the input features, unless we specifically code in additional features that are functions of the initial feature set. This may result in a model that has greater bias and less variance. I chose to apply Logistic regression because of the above strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random Forest\n",
    "    * Random Forests are an extension of decision trees and can be generally used either for regression or classification. One strength of Random Forests is that the tree structure of the model allows one to capture elements of non-linearity in the features that may result in better performance. Another strength is that the random nature of the algorithm in selecting among subsets training examples per tree in the forest and among subsets of features at each split in the tree will help the model avoid overfitting and thus perform better on held-out test data. Additionally, Random Forests make no assumptions about the underlying distributions of the individual features (compared with, e.g. linear regression). A possible weakness here is that each split in the tree for a categorical variable will choose among the levels for that variable, and since we've used one-hot encoding for the categorical variables, the algorithm will be searching for good splits in a more sparse feature space. Another weakness is that it is somewhat more difficult to intuitively extract feature importances from Random Forests. Although we can get a magnitude of the feature's importance, the contribution of one feature to the final prediction and the directionality of how that feature impacts the final prediction are more difficult to obtain than in the logistic regression case. Finally, another potential weakness may be that if we had only a few important features and many unimportant features, we may get unlucky and create many trees that were poorly performing, reducing our performance. I chose to apply Random Forest as a quick test to see of capturing non-linearities would yield a better result (compared to Logistic regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "* K-nearest neighbors\n",
    "    * K-nearest neighbors is another algorithm that may be used for either regression or classification. Strengths of K-nearest neighbors are that there is very low training time since we do not actually construct a model, we just look up distances to K-neighbors and evaluate a vote. The lack of a parametric model yields another strength, which is that KNN is somewhat robust to outliers. One weakness is that for each point we want to serve a prediction for, we have to scan the entire dataset to find the K-closest points. In contrast, the two other algorithms above are trained once, and then for each prediction point we just have to evaluate a trained model. This could however be seen as a strength or a weakness depending on the speficic context of how we intend to use the algorithm. Another weakness is that we gain no intuitive understanding or parametric model to aid our understanding of the situation, we just issue predictions but do not learn anything about the underlying processes that cause an example to fall into a certain category. I chose to apply KNN as it may be the most naive model to try in this case, and it may serve as a good baseline. Additionally the data are small, predicting on held-out data will not be an issue."

    "Given the available data, limited resources, and cost, we should pursue logistic regression as the best model. Logistic regression, without any additional work, provides the best performance on the test data set compared to the other models. Importantly, the performance of the model on the training set is closer to the performance on the testing set than for all the other models, which means we have a better chance that the logistic model will perform well on other students which we have not evaluated yet. \n",
    "Additionally, Logistic Regression will help us use our limited resources better. Logistic Regression gives us a score for each student rather than only a binary prediction of passing, and we can use this score to rank students by risk of failure, and then prioritize our resources accordingly. Choosing Logistic Regression will also give us the added benefit of insight into which characteristics of the students are most influential as to whether they will pass or fail, so we can use this information to give specific advice in our interventions.\n",
    "Looking to the future, if we were to have more data available, it may be a good idea to continue exploring the Random Forest model, but if we are limited by both traning data and time to complete the analysis, this model currently overfits the data, which means it does not perform well on students outside of the training data. In short, we should avoid the Random Forest model in the short-term and stick with the Logistic Regression."

    "At a high level, logistic regression aims to predict a specific attribute such as passed, or not passed, for a student. Logistic regression will take our features for each student as an input, and then output a score between 0 and 1, where in our case we'll say \"not passed\" is 0, and \"passed\" is 1. Since we have many features for each student, logistic regression multiplies each of those features by a weight, and attempts to find the weights for each feature that give us the best results on our prediction task. Once we've found those weights for each feature, we can make a prediction for any student by multiplying their features by the appropriate weights, and evaluating the logistic function for that combination of weights and features, which will give us the score between 0 and 1."

    "    * 2) The other parameter we do a grid search over is whether or not to do class weighting to account for class imbalance when calculating the cost function, and since the classes are not heavily imbalanced, we don't seem to gain much here\n",
